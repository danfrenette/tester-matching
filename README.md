# Tester Matching

### Ongoing thought process
 - Need to import test data via seeds
 - Import testing suite from another project
 - Setup models
 - Setup a form with multiple inputs in simple form
 - Filter bug information in simple form and group by user
    - Not sure how to group by a user if there's no bugs for a certain user
 - Display in a table
